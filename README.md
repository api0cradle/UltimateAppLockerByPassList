# Ultimate AppLocker ByPass List
The goal of this repository is to document the most common and known techniques to bypass AppLocker. 
Since AppLocker can be configured in different ways I maintain a verified list of bypasses (that works against the default AppLocker rules) and a list with possible bypass technique (depending on configuration) or claimed to be a bypass by someone. 
I also have a list of generic bypass techniques as well as a legacy list of methods to execute through DLLs.
   
   
   
## INDEXED LISTS

* [Generic-AppLockerbypasses.md](Generic-AppLockerbypasses.md)
* [VerifiedAppLockerBypasses.md](VerifiedAppLockerBypasses.md)
* [UnverifiedAppLockerBypasses.md](UnverifiedAppLockerBypasses.md)
* [DLL-Execution.md](DLL-Execution.md)
   
   
   
## YML
I have also created everything in YML format so it the data can be reused.
The YML files can be found under the YML folder. 
      
     
     
For details on how I verified and how to create the default rules you can check my blog:

## BLOCK RULES
The rules can be found in the AppLocker-BlockPolicies folder.
